    Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy. 
    There are two types of photosynthetic processes: oxygenic photosynthesis and anoxygenic photosynthesis. 
    The general principles of anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis are very similar, but oxygenic photosynthesis is the most common and is seen in plants, algae and cyanobacteria.
    During photosynthesis, plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight energy.
    Chlorophyll is the green pigment that captures sunlight energy for photosynthesis.
